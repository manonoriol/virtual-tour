    <p>Gallery360 is a Paris based creative studio conceiving 360° and 3D virtual visits.
  We have created a solution that allows you to present a virtual visit of your space on your website,
  through a unique and interactive experience. Our tool enables you to tell stories with multifunctional hotspots
  and clickable objects. With a cross-cultural
  and limitless approach of design, our work covers many different fields including contemporary art,
  design and fashion for both self-initiated and commissioned projects.</p>
