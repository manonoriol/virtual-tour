  <p>Gallery360 is a Paris based creative studio conceiving 360° and 3D virtual visits.
Museums, galleries, showrooms, fashion shows, trade shows - give your worldwide
clients and leads the opportunity to come again at your show. We have created a virtual
visit solution that allows you to present a virtual visit of your space on your website
through a unique interactive experience : tell actual stories with multifunctional hotspots
and clickable objects that your audience discovers when walking through the tour. With a cross-cultural
and limitless approach of design, our work covers many different fields including contemporary art,
design and fashion for both self-initiated and commissioned projects.</p>
